# 🛒 Maven Market Retail Analytics Dashboard

Welcome to my Power BI project! This dashboard was built as part of a **Maven Analytics** retail analytics simulation.

It delivers a clear and actionable overview of business performance for **Maven Market**, a modern retail chain offering groceries, household goods, and everyday consumer products. The goal of the project is to turn raw transactional data into insights that support strategic decision-making across operations, sales, and customer behavior.
